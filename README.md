# Square Plate Temperature Distribution
## Program Description
The program will generate a plot representing the temperature distribution inside the square plate. Each color represents the temperature at that point.

The graph will provide a visual representation of how the temperature varies across the plate, showing areas of higher and lower temperatures.

The density of node distribution in this particular case is equal n = 41, the number of nodes with unknowns is 40x40.
## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. View the generated graph to observe the temperature distribution inside the plate.
